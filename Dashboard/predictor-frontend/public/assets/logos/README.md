Place SVG files named exactly like team abbreviations or full names used in the schedule. Example filenames:

- NO.svg
- ATL.svg
- "New Orleans Saints.svg" (not recommended; prefer abbreviation-based names)

The `MatchupBanner` uses `/assets/logos/{TeamName}.svg` and falls back to hiding the image when it can't be loaded.
